<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p><strong>$PANTS</strong> is not just a memecoin. It is a digital relic. A meme of mythic proportions. A folk tale from the internet’s subconscious, now immortalized on the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>While other tokens chase virality, $PANTS walks—unbothered, timeless, grounded in something real.</p>
<p>It is not a trend. It is the origin chain of $wif culture.</p>

<h2>I. The Three Arcs of Lore</h2>

<h3>Arc I — The Sighting (2016)</h3>
<p>In 2016, a red toy poodle wearing pants and a backpack went viral in China. The dog—later known as Teddy—walked upright with inexplicable swagger. Media outlets from People’s Daily to the Daily Mail, Sina.cn, and Naver blogged about him. A 2017 Facebook post by LADbible tagged Teddy as “Poodle is running late to school…” garnering 2 million views..</p>
<ul>
  <li>People’s Daily China (2016)</li>
  <li>Daily Mail UK article (Nov 2016)</li>
  <li>Daily Motion video (Nov 2016)</li>
  <li>Sina.cn article (archived)</li>
  <li>Korean blog on Naver (Nov 2016)</li>
  <li>LADbible Facebook post</li>
</ul>
<p>This wasn’t just a meme. It was a new archetype.</p>

<h3>Arc II — The Linguistic Shift (2019)</h3>
<p>In May 2019, Jack Scobes (now @scobes97208) tweeted:
“wtf a dog wif pants on? ok but he do be looking kinda fresh tho.”
That tweet—though lost to suspension—was preserved on Reddit and echoed across gaming Twitter. It introduced the phrase “dog wif,” which became foundational to WIF memetics. Later that year, @wundxr tweeted:
“oh shit wtf a dog wif pants on bro?? naa ima just let him be bro hes vibing rn.”
This moment birthed a new meme language: [animal] wif [clothing]. Jack launched dogwifpants merch. Meme culture shifted.</p>

<h3>Arc III — The Movement (2025– )</h3>
<p>In 2025, pump.fun historian @Narracanz unearthed the forgotten roots and launched $PANTS—not to chase virality, but to preserve the vibe. With community support, $PANTS became a tribute to the culture that came before the chart.</p>
<p>Dog wif pants resurfaced in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The @Dogwifpants_OG X account</li>
  <li>History threads and archived memes</li>
  <li>Fun, new Dogwifpants content created by the community</li>
</ul>
<p>This wasn’t revival. It was rightful restoration. Thus, the $PANTS movement was born—a revival of meme roots, a resurrection of $wif culture in its purest form.</p>

<h2>II. Teddy: The Meme Prophet</h2>
<p>Teddy is not a mascot. He is an archetype—the Wandering Fool, the Meme Prophet, the patron saint of those who walk their own path. He doesn’t bark. He doesn’t pump. He walks. Upright. Alone. Vibing.</p>
<p>His journey mirrors our own in crypto: navigating absurdity with style, wearing our metaphorical pants through the chaos. He is divine in his mundanity.</p>

<h2>III. $PANTS vs. the Meta</h2>
<p>While $WIF took the hat and ran, $PANTS stayed grounded. In the memeverse:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hats = Flex, clout, performative alpha</li>
  <li>Pants = Function, humility, movement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You wear a hat to be seen. You wear pants to move.</strong>$PANTS is not anti-meta. It is <strong>post-meta.</strong> It walks after the cycles, through the noise, beneath the hype. It is the coin of the In-Betweeners. The Meme Pilgrims. The walkers.</p>

<h2>IV. Meme Timeline</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2016 – Teddy goes viral. Media covers it worldwide.</li>
  <li>2019 – Jack coins “dog wif pants” tweet (preserved via Reddit).</li>
  <li>2019 – The gaming community expands the lingo.</li>
  <li>2019 – “dog wif hat” is birthed in the gaming community</li>
  <li>2024 – Dogwifhat coin ($WIF) explodes in crypto.</li>
  <li>2025 – $PANTS is launched to restore and preserve.</li>
</ul>

<h2>V. Key Lore Figures</h2>

<h3>🧠 Jack Scobes — Linguistic Spark</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Name: Jack Scobes</li>
  <li>Alias: @scobes97208 on X</li>
  <li>Role: Original voice behind the "dog wif" phrasing</li>
  <ul>Contributions:
    <li>Coined iconic meme lines “wtf a dog wif pants on? ok but he do be looking kinda fresh tho” in 2019.</li>
    <li>Created and sold early “dogwifpantson” merch that circulated in gaming subcultures.</li>
    <li>Shared personal photos and documentation linking himself to the meme.</li>
    <li>Became a cult figure in “wif” linguistics—shaping how $WIF would later self-identify.</li>
    <li>Interacted closely with meme amplifiers like Mako to embed the phrase deeper into online culture.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
  <p>Jack gave the meme its name. Without his wording, there is no $wif. No $pants. Just a dog.</p>

<h3>🧙‍ Mako — Meme Catalyst</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Name: Martín Rodríguez Lorente</li>
  <li>Alias: @mako on X (lol.fandom profile)</li>
  <li>Role: Early amplifier of the dogwifpants meme in 2019</li>
  <ul>Contributions:
    <li>Posted high-traction tweets like “dog wif pants” and “Doggos wif hats” in mid-2019.</li>
    <li>Interacted directly with Jack (@scobes97208), helping preserve and spread the "wif + clothing" meme format.</li>
    <li>Promoted Jack’s “dogwifpantson” merch line in gaming subcultures.</li>
    <li>Documented Jack’s real-life dogwifpants tattoo.</li>
    <li>Bridged meme culture with gaming audiences across Twitter and Reddit.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
  
<p>Without Mako, dogwifpants might’ve stayed a one-off novelty. Instead, thanks to his amplification, the meme found a foothold across communities and lived on to inspire $PANTS years later.</p>

<p>“He’s like a dog… but wif pants on.”</p>

<h3>🐾 Teddy</h3>
<p>The ur-meme. The relic. The walker of destinies. First of his kind. Wears the Pants of Destiny.</p>

<h2>VI. Pants Energy</h2>
<p>Pants energy is grounded. Goofy. Graceful. It doesn’t scream. It strolls. It’s meme longevity over momentary hype. A refuge for the internet-weary. A fit for the vibekeepers.</p>


<h2>VII. Culture First. Then Charts.</h2>
<p>Teddy isn’t a Shiba. He’s a red poodle in pants. That makes him universal. Memorable. Instantly recognizable. And now—iconic.</p>
<ul>
  <li>“WIF pants on”</li>
  <li>“the $pants stay on”</li>
  <li>“He do be lookin kinda fresh tho”</li>
</ul>
<p>Dog wif pants is the origin story. The overlooked champion. The missing piece of the full fit.</p>
<p>$WIF brought the hat. $PANTS brought the foundation. Together? Full lore, full fit, full culture.</p>

<h2>VIII. Closing Vibes</h2>
<p>$PANTS is not a coin to chase.</p>
<p>It’s a path to walk.</p>
<p>It’s the meme before the monetization.</p>
<p>The vibe before the virality.</p>
<p>The pants before the pump.</p>
<p>He walked so they could run.</p>
<p>Now he's back. 🐕 👖</p>
